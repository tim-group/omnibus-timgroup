to bundle any project you must:
 * mkdir and chown /opt/$project_name to the user that runs the build

to bundle "omnibus" itself you must:
 * run: gem install omnibus (this will overwrite /usr/local/bin/omnibus)
 * uncomment "local_software_dirs" in omnibus.rb
 * increase 'build_iteration' in config/projects/omnibus.rb
 * git clone "omnibus-software" to the "local_software_dirs" path
 * run: /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/gems/omnibus-4.0.0/bin/omnibus build omnibus, i.e. not the /opt/omnibus one
 * use deb.sh to upload and promote the new .deb
 * optionally restore /usr/local/bin/omnibus to point back to /opt/omnibus/bin/omnibus
alternatively use omnibus_devkit to build omnibus, and vice versa.

to bundle "devkit" you must:
 * install a separate 'omnibus' (not the devkit one)
 * upload package with deb.sh
 * promote package with deb.sh

other info:
 * you cannot run two builds at the same time
